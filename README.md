# Lana vs Jesus

Live site: [Lana vs. Jesus](https://joshuachoi0508.github.io/Lana-vs-Jesus/)

`Lana vs Jesus` is a humorous project that compares the singer Lana Del Rey with Jesus with charts/diagrams made with `D3`, `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

## Visuals
### Word Cloud
Text analysis section of the project has two word clouds. Each word's text-size is based on the frequency of the word used in a certain writing (in this case Lana's songs and the Bible) and the color of the word is based on the polarity of the word (green for positive/neutral and red for negative). Whenever the page is refreshed, the clouds appear with cool animation. It was made using d3.layout.cloud created by Jason Davies.
