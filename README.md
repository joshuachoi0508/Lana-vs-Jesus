# Lana vs Jesus

Live site: [Lana vs. Jesus](https://joshuachoi0508.github.io/Lana-vs-Jesus/)

`Lana vs Jesus` is a humorous project that compares the singer Lana Del Rey with Jesus with charts/diagrams made with `D3`, `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

## Visuals
### Word Cloud
Text Analysis section of the project has two word clouds. Each word's text-size is based on the frequency of the word used in a certain writing (in this case Lana's songs and the Bible) and the color of the word is based on the polarity of the word (green for positive/neutral and red for negative). Whenever the page is refreshed, the clouds appear with cool animation. It was made using d3.layout.cloud created by Jason Davies.

Writing Credits section has two pie charts. Visitors can hover over the charts to see different writers involved in writing Lana's songs and the Bible. They were made using d3 layout created by Lisa Nguyen.

### Bar Chart
Social Media Presence section has three different social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube) and Lana/Jesus's social presence on each platform. Similar to the pie chart, users can hover over the charts to see the exact number of followers/subscribers Lana/Jesus has in a particular platform.
