  <h1 class="site-title">Why is Lana Del Rey better than Jesus?</h1>

  <!-- text analysis -->
  <h2 class="text-analysis-title">Text Analysis</h2>
  <h3 class="sub-subtitle">Lana</h3>
  <script src='javascript/lana_word_cloud.js'></script>
  <h3 class="sub-subtitle">Jesus</h3>
  <script src='javascript/jesus_word_cloud.js'></script>
  <p>
    Above word clouds represent some of the most frequently used words in Lana Del Rey's songs and the Bible. 
    Green words represent neutral/positive words and <u class="red">red words</u> represent <u class="red">negative</u> words.
    Just from a glance, you can tell how many more <u class="red">red</u> words the bible has compared to Lana's songs.
    </br>
    </br>
    The Bible frequently uses <u class="red">scary</u> words like <u class="red">blood, sin,
    evil, holy ghost, and my personal least favorite, work</u>. It also constantly tells the readers to not be <u class="red">afraid</u> and don't be <u class="red">scared</u>
    which implies that there probably are things to be scared and afraid of in the Bible. It makes me very uneasy and afraid.
    </br>
    </br>
    In comparison, Lana's lyrics are full of <u class="green">green</u>. She sings about fun things like <u class="green">Coney Island, party, 
    Hollywood, doing it like it's hot, and my personal favorite, alcohol.</u> She's spreading so much positivity that just reading the word bubble 
    makes me want to get up and dance! 
    </br>
    </br>  
    Even when the Bible and Lana use similar words, the word choices really show how much sweeter Lana's words are compared to the words of the Bible.
    While the Bible uses cold words like <u class="red">"wife"</u> to refer to the significant other, Lana uses a much warmer word like <u class="green">"baby"</u>.
    While the Bible uses <u class="red">father</u> to refer to the dad, Lana uses a much friendlier word, <u class="green">daddy! Daddy</u> is actually one of Lana's
    most frequently used words of all time, further proving what a family/dad loving person she is!
    </br>
    </br>
    The last comparison I'll be making comes from the use of food in the Bible versus Lana's songs. In the top 100 most frequently used words in the Bible, 
    the only food mentioned is bread. Just bread. <u class="red">Not even garlic bread</u>. Just bread. Not a cake, not a bagel. <u class="red">It's. Just. Bread.</u>
    In comparison, Lana's all about having options and enjoying different foods! Want some sweets? Lana can give you <u class="green">lollipops!</u> Not a fan of lollipops?
    How about some <u class="green">ice cream</u> then? Want something healthy? She's got <u class="green">peaches!</u>
    Thirsty? Lana has choices! <u class="green">mountain dew, coca cola, or pepsi cola, which one would you like?</u> you make the decision! Lana will keep you nourished.

    The above graph represents everyone involved in writing the Bible and Lana's songs. The Bible's graph looks much prettier than Lana's graph. 
    That's because the Bible was <u class="red">written by so many different people. More shockingly, Jesus was not even one of the writers</u>
    even though the Bible is widely proclaimed to be the words of Jesus. Very. Interesting.
  </br>
  </br>
    In comparison, you can clearly see that Lana wrote most of her lyrics with minimal help from other writers. On top of that, she's always gotten the 
    <u class="green">first writer credit</u> except for Florida Kilos and songs that she's covered from other artists further proving what a true artist and a perfect human being she is.

  <p>
    Social media presence is one of the most important factors in deciding a person's worth.
    <u class="red">Billboard Music Awards,</u> one of the most prestigious award shows in the world,
    uses social media presence to judge artists' worth and give awards every year.
  </br>
  </br>
    Above chart shows how much more Instagram, Twitter followers and YouTube subscribers Lana has compared to 
    Jesus. In addition, extremely shockingly, Jesus's accounts are <u class="red">all unofficial accounts</u> run by someone other than Jesus. 
    Above charts, along with the fact that his last and only work was released roughly <u class="red">2000 years ago,</u> really makes me question whether
    Jesus even cares about his fans and his own worth.
